        &nbsp;Marcy Taylor Pattinson was born in Illonois and double-majored in History and Political Science at the University of Wisconsin. After graduating in 1969, she spent eight months traveling the world before taking residence in San Francisco, where she took a job working in the Bank of America building at 555 California Street. Working there in May 1971, she became a self-dubbed "international heroine," "Marcy Taylor the Flag Girl," after defending the building's US flag during an anti-war rally (see <a href="//archives.chicagotribune.com/1971/05/21/page/21/article/flag-rescue-changes-girls-life">this link </a>for more information.) She is currently retired and resides in Marin County, California. Marcy is a joy to be around for her ever-positive mentality and interesting stories, and I consider her a part of our family.
